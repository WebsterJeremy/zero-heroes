# Zero Heroes

Client: Dr Jean-Marc Hero, Senior Lecturer in Biology (Ecology/Organismal Biology)

Climate change and understanding our impact on the planet are critical issues not just the
current generation but those to come. Appreciating our daily activities and the cost everyday
interaction has, is lost on many people. In an effort to educate and create a zero carbon
environment within the university you are tasked with creating a game that engages the player
in an experience where they see the impact and rewards associated with their normal life.

The intention for the game is to present the player with an understanding of ecology, conservation
and their carbon footprint. The game will look at managing the land with a focus on indigenous
culture. Each player will start with a small plot of land that they will need to manage and care
for. Once they have demonstrated appropriate awareness and generated enough in game credit
the player should be able to purchase larger plots of land and continue their conservation effort.

The game should be deployed primarily on mobile devices but should also be playable on
HTML5. There should be associated inventory, marketplace, and reward systems incorporated
in the game based on input from external activities and carbon credit mechanics.

The game itself is intended to be played by everyone associated with Flinders University. This
includes all students, academics, administration staff, and where applicable contract workers.
The goal is to create the first zero carbon university in Australia through the game and other
external initiatives.

Where necessary, the client will provide direct face-to-face guidance on the purpose and mechanics
of the game that will need to be incorporated. You will have the opportunity to seek clarification
and modify the deliverable for the game in an iterative, development environment.
