  description: "The early adopters of the Zero Waste movement in the U.S. \u2014
    Seattle, San Francisco and Oakland, to name a few \u2014 have had their hands
    full as the pioneers trying to shift from waste management to resource management.
    Their work has paved the way for much of the success we see today in the U.S.,
    including 45 communities with Zero Waste plans/goals and 200-plus communities
    composting food scraps from residents.\n\nNo one has all the answers yet, but
    we know enough now to help any community in the U.S. make serious strides quickly
    toward a Zero Waste future. And that\u2019s critical, because we don\u2019t have
    time for 25-year goals."
